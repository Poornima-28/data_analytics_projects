Project Description

The commercial department of a telecom operator mega line wants to know which plans among the two prepaid plan they offer brings more revenue in order to adjust advertising budget

Task: Analyse clientâ€™s behaviour and determine which plan brings more revenue

Plans Description: Megaline rounds seconds up to minutes, and megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasted just one second, it will be counted as one minute. For web traffic, individual web sessions are not rounded up. Instead, the total for the month is rounded up. If someone uses 1025 megabytes this month, they will be charged for 2 gigabytes.
